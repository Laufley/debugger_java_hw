What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
To debug.
The application will run normally until it reaches the breackpoint line, and when that happens, it will activate the debugger console. This debugger will actually run before the line of code (in the video case, before the game.deal())


Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
no


How do we debug the next line of code?
From the debugger console click on Step Over. 
It will run the line of code of the breakpoint and then it will jump down to the next line.

What does the step into command do?
it will jump into the method we have in the breakpoint (which means that will take us to where the method is written within the propper class) and it will pause at the top of that method.


What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
when we evaluate we obtain a result.
Evaluate experssion allows us to evaluate a single line of code (a method for example) whilst evaluating a code fragment allows us to evaluate multiple lines and even to create temporary variables
